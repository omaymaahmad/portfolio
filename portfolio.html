          <h6>Phase One Project</h6>
          <p class="card-text">For my first project, I worked with my team mates to make a web application that uses API keys to gather recipe and movie data. User's can insert a singular ingredient and the API will provide them with a random recipe, same with the movie API - a random word can be searched and users are presented with a movie. The application was created through JavaScript, Bulma, HTML & CSS, the site is responsive to desktop, mobile and tablet devices.

          <h4>Workout Weekly</h4>
          <h6>Phase Two Project</h6>
          <p class="card-text">For my second project, I worked with my team mates to make a workout calender application that can be used to organise an exercise schedule around working engagements. Once signed up adn logged in, users can fill out their weekly work engagements. In any gaps they are able to request a workout video from the library of over 200 curated YouTube exercise videos from some of the best known YouTube fitness channels. The application was created through JavaScript, Node.js/Express.j Sequelize/MySQL, Google API, TDD with Jest.js, ESLint/Travis CI, Moment.js, Passport/Bcrypt, Axios & CSS, the site is responsive to desktop, mobile and tablet devices.

          <h6>Phase One Homework 5</h6>
          <p class="card-text">The week 5 homework was one of my personal favourites, focussing on implementing local storage use I created a web application that allows users to schedule their working day. The time blocks were styled to change colour according to time - grey for the past, pink for present and green for the future. After typing the text if users click the "Save Task" button the information is saved to local storage and remains even after refreshing the page.

          <h4>Eat The Burger</h4>
          <h6>Phase Two Homework 13</h6>
          <p class="card-text">The week 13 homework was particularly challenging, utilising Express.js and Sequelize to create a restaurant application that lets users input the names of burgers they would like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name it appears on the left side of the page. By clicking the "Devour it!" button the burger will shift to the right side. All burgers are stored in the database, whether devoured or not!
